				<h1> My Goals </h1>

				<h2> Pass all my courses </h2>
				<p> 
				One of my short goals is to pass all of my first-year courses with a good mark so I can have honor on my diploma. Also to learn as much as I can from my faculty so it can help me when I do my work placement.
				</p>

				<h2> Work opportunity </h2>
				<p>
				My second short-term goal is to find a co-op opportunity to gain relevant employment skills and realistic expectations of the work force before graduation.
				</p>

				<h2> Communication skill </h2>
				<p> 
				As English is not my first language, I want to continue developing my communication skills. I want to communicate effectively with people and build my own confidence so I can feel comfortable handling any situation. 
				</p>
				
				<img src="goal3.jfif" alt="" />
				<h2> Daily walk  </h2>
				<p>
				My fourth short-term goal is to get out for a walk at least once each day. Since I sit on a chair most of the time doing my assignments and work, it is important that I take care of myself.
				</p>

				<h2> Buy a house plan </h2>
				<p>
				My last short term goal is to increase my monthly saving once I start working so I can buy a house in the next few years.
				</p>
				
				<img src="goal6.jpg" alt="" />
				<h2> Learn leadership experience </h2>
				<p>
				One of my long-term goals is to gain leadership experience. One day I hope to become a team leader or manager, but I know I will only achieve that goal if I work hard, gain experience and impress my employer. 
				</p>
				
				<img src="goal7.jfif" alt="" />
				<h2> Gain my diploma </h2>
				<p>
				Gaining a diploma is something I have always wanted to achieve, and I will work hard for that. Doing that will improve my communication skills and it will increase my knowledge which I hope to use in the workplace and in everyday experience.
